You can open a Sisu Udana Savings Account at any of our branches Island-wide. As a result of our expansion process, most schools across the Island already have their very own Sisu Udana Savings Unit, where the banking activities are carried out by the children themselves. This not only gives them encouragement to save but also promotes the banking experience to children at a very young age. A child is able to go to one of these Savings Units at their school and open a Sisu Udana savings account. Thereafter, they can deposit money into their account at any time they want.
